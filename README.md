## Gaerisson's presentation !

⚠️ My main discord account "Gaerisson#1337" was hacked (it is not me for now) **(you can delete my old account because Discord "is unable to restore access to me", it will be deleted)** ⚠️

My name is Gaëtan, I am 23 years old, I'm from France (Loir-et-Cher), I am currently in SNEM training (Systems and Networks Engineering Manager) (RISR in French).

I manage a small multigaming community (HeavyBox), so I have a dedicated server at OVH with a nice ProxMox and therefore lots of containers / VMs for different services, like Youtube Downloader / Game Servers / VPN / WebRadio Bot / API etc...

I have been an amateur photographer since I was 18 (📷 http://bit.ly/2LPkUjL) photography is therefore part of my hobbies, like:
 - DIY (electronics (Arduino / Various projects / Home automation))
 - the WEB / Application dev (GLUA / PHP / C# / NodeJS)
 - IT (troubleshooting / network / help)
 - Drawing ... (digital> available on my Insta) (beginner)
 - 3D printing (for now custom CR10S, later Prusa XL)
(etc ... I try to diversify in different fields)
